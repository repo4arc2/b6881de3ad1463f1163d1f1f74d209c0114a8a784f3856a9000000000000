它们不仅仅是线性的
It's more than a linear path.

13
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,740
而是一个拥有无限可能的棱镜
It's a prism of endless possibility,

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,710
一个选择便能开辟出无数个现实
where a single choice can branch out into infinite realities,

15
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,190
创造出与你所知不同的平行世界
creating alternate worlds from the ones you know.

我是观察者

I am your guide through these vast new realities.

{\an8}星期一

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,540
有个设想  聚集一群...
There was an idea to bring together a group of--

23
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,590
能力超群的人吗
Remarkable people?

24
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,750
看他们组成的团队是不是更强大
To see if they could become something more?

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,330
我知道  我听过这番言论
I know. I've heard the speech.

26
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,770
那你一定知道其中的利害关系
Then you realize what's at stake.

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,660
所以我才意外
Which is why I'm surprised you'd wanna bet

28
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,970
你居然把复仇者计划的未来押在那货身上
the future of the Avengers Initiative on that.

29
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,050
斯塔克虽然很古怪  但他有潜力
Stark may be eccentric, but he's got potential.

30
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,760
他有宿醉才对
What he's got is a hangover.

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,930
我有没有告诉过你  有一次
Did I ever tell you about this one time

32
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,220
我招募了一个俄罗斯刺客
I actually recruited a Russian assassin

33
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,540
加入我的美国秘密行动小组
to join my American covert ops team?

34
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,710
依稀有印象
Vaguely rings a bell.

35
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,620
那你就该知道  我这人不怕冒险
Then you should know, I'm not afraid of a big swing.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,600
先生  我要请你从甜甜圈上下来
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to exit the donut.

37
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,400
我告诉过你  我不想加入你的绝密男子组合
I told you I don't wanna join your super-secret boyband.

38
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,760
不不  瞧  我记得  你什么事都自己干
No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,040
-结果怎么样呢  -我经历过更糟的
- How's that working out for you? - I've been worse.

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,460
你已经成了个问题  而我得解决你这个问题
You've become a problem, a problem I have to deal with.

41
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,310
不管你怎么想  你不是我宇宙的中心
Contrary to your belief, you are not the center of my universe.

42
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,480
-我懂  -扎他
- I get it. - Hit him.

43
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,720
天呐  她刚对我做了什么
God. What'd she just do to me?

44
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,890
是我们刚为你做了什么
What did we just do for you?

45
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,880
那是二氧化锂  能缓解你的病症
That's lithium dioxide. It's gonna take the edge off.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,110
不能治愈  只能缓解症状
It's not a cure, it just abates the symptoms?

47
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,730
斯塔克  你没事吧
Stark! You okay?

48
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,270
-斯塔克  -托尼  托尼
- Stark! - Tony. Tony!

49
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,260
他死了
He's dead.

50
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,570
人类  极其渴望面对不可能之事
Humanity, so eager, so willing to face the impossible,

51
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,800
然而却看不到大局
yet blind to the bigger picture.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,270
一周之内  相继发生了三件毫无关系又离奇的事件
Inside one week, three strange and separate stories unfolded.

53
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,850
一个天才与恶魔及自己的心魔抗争
A genius battled his demons both inside and out,

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,140
世人见识到藏在他体内的怪物
while the world met the monster hiding in the man.

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,260
一个神族王子落到地球
And a godly prince fell to Earth.

56
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,550
我是观察者
I am the Watcher.

57
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,710
人类看到的是混乱
And where humans see chaos,

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,060
而我看到的则是一个熔炉
I see the crucible that would transform

59
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,230
会将这群个体锻造为一队英雄
this collection of individuals into a team of heroes.

60
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,520
至少  在其中一个宇宙里是这样发展的
At least, that's how things played out in one universe.

61
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,230
但在这个宇宙
But in this one...

62
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,100
{\an8}周二

63
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,500
长官  我们找到了
Sir, we found it.

64
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,620
我现在有点忙  科尔森
Kind of in the middle of something here, Coulson.

65
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,020
这事不能等  长官  周围居民开始好奇了
Not sure it can wait, sir. Locals are getting curious.

66
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,660
封锁周边  告诉现场小队我在往那边赶
Set up a perimeter and tell the team I'm en route.

67
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,780
我可能没那么喜欢托尼·斯塔克  但不是我杀的他
I may not have been a fan of Tony Stark, but I didn't kill him.

68
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,480
省省吧  见皮尔斯再说
Save your spin for Pierce.

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,840
他想让你第一时间到纽约接受审问
He wants you in New York first thing for questioning.

70
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,760
让我们单独聊聊
Wanna give us a minute?

71
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,470
不是我干的
This wasn't me.

72
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,380
我知道  但神盾局有规章
I know that, but S.H.I.E.L.D. has protocols,

73
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,940
所以我跟你一样无能为力
so my hands, like yours, are tied.

74
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,860
-你知道这铐不住我  -我还指望它呢
- You know these won't hold me. - Oh, I'm counting on it.

75
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,220
神盾局内部有人对斯塔克的解药动了手脚
Someone inside S.H.I.E.L.D. compromised Stark's antidote.

76
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,290
我需要一名外部人士揪出内鬼
I need someone on the outside to find out who.

77
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,720
你确定还要把赌注压在我身上吗  老大
Sure you wanna take another big swing on me, boss?

78
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,240
这是我最有把握的一次
Safest bet I'll ever make.

79
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,360
这么严肃
So serious.

80
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,390
我们也许应该放点音乐
Maybe we should get some tunes going.

81
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,740
缓和一下气氛
Lighten the mood.

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,700
你们真无聊  给  帮我拿一下这个
You guys are no fun. Here. Mind holding these for me?

83
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,450
没问题...什么
Of course. Uh... What?

84
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,900
我始终不懂他看中她哪点了
I never did get what he sees in her.

85
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,110
她确实打拳很厉害
Sure, she can land a punch,

86
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,450
但都只是因为打得出其不意罢了
but only 'cause people don't expect it.

87
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,580
怎么回事  停车
What? Stop! Stop the truck!

88
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,600
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

89
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,420
别啊
Come on!

90
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,240
{\an8}新墨西哥州  普恩特安提奎

91
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,240
至少我们可以确定
Best we can tell,

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,420
它非常强大  不是这里的东西
it's extremely powerful and not from around here.

93
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,400
电磁  中子  生命射线辐射  统统超标
Electromagnetic, neutron, vita radiations, all off the charts.

94
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,270
这听起来一点都不吉利
Well, that doesn't sound ominous at all.

95
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,100
一整夜都在打雷
It's been happening all night.

96
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,050
这件东西还有点脾气
The artifact has a bit of an attitude.

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
还有  没人能举起它
Also, no one can lift it.

98
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,580
连杰克逊都不行  他可是经常做健身训练的
Not even Jackson and he does CrossFit.

99
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,610
如此强大的东西丢了
Something that powerful goes missing,

100
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,590
总会有人来找的
someone always comes looking.

101
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,510
我们只能祈祷  这人是我们的盟友
We just have to cross our fingers that someone is an ally.

102
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,150
我们怎么做
So, what's the move?

103
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,140
跟以往一样  抱最好的希望  做最坏的准备
Same as always. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

104
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,950
有人遇袭  拉响警报
We got a man down. Sound the alarms.

105
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,730
最坏的来了
I think the worst just got here.

106
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,830
科尔森  回话
Coulson, talk to me.

107
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,820
封锁被突破了  多名特工遇袭  还有...
We got a perimeter breach. Multiple agents down and...

108
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,730
我看到入侵者了
I got visual on the intruder.

109
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,370
白人男性  二十五岁左右
He's a Caucasian male, mid-twenties with...

110
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,890
头发特别柔顺
really great hair.

111
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,750
你说什么
Excuse me?

112
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,740
我描述得很精准  长官  他可俊美了
It's an accurate description. Sir, he's gorgeous.

113
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,360
-我需要有人在空中侦察  巴顿  -在做了
- I need eyes in the sky. Barton. - Already on it.

114
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,710
他要接近锤子
He's making a move on the hammer.

115
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,650
一击致命  长官  就等你一声令下
One shot, one kill, sir. Just say the word.

116
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,660
先别出手  我看看会发生什么
Hold your fire. I wanna see this.

117
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,590
科尔森对头发的描述没错  真不错
Whoa. Coulson wasn't lying about the hair. That's nice.

118
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,410
弗瑞  机不可失时不再来
Fury, now or never.

119
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,670
你先等...
Hold your...

120
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,270
该死  巴顿  都和你说了先别动
Damn it, Barton. I told you to stand down.

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,810
我没动  不是我  我没放箭
I did! Wasn't me! I didn't shoot!

122
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,350
放下武器
Drop your weapon!

123
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,240
我发誓  我没放箭
I swear, I didn't shoot.

124
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,530
你的箭可不是这么说的
Your arrow would indicate otherwise.

125
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,400
这根本说不通  我从不手滑  也从不误射
This doesn't make any sense. I don't slip. I don't misfire.

126
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,460
-闯入者情况如何  -已经死亡
- What's the word on our intruder? - Dead.

127
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,550
如果他的血样可信
And if his blood samples are to be believed,

128
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,450
他已经快一千岁了  还不是地球人
he's almost a thousand years old and not of this world.

129
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,550
先是斯塔克  现在又是海滩健美先生
First Stark, now Muscle Beach.

130
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,550
24小时内  已经有两个神盾局高潜力人物
That's two high value S.H.I.E.L.D. Targets

131
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,320
死在我们自己特工手里
killed by our own agents inside 24 hours.

132
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,250
-巴顿还坚持他的说辞吗  -他气坏了
- Barton's sticking to his story? - He's pretty bent out of shape.

133
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,480
-拒绝和任何人交谈  -他会愿意和我谈
- Won't talk to anyone. - He'll talk to me.

134
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,020
醒醒  睡美人
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

135
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,170
巴顿
Barton.

136
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,610
巴顿  科尔森  快叫医生
Barton. Coulson, get a medic.

137
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,330
这到底是怎么...你们让谁进来过
How could this... Who did you let in here?

138
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,700
-没人  -没人
- No one. - No one.

139
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,290
挺住  挺住
Stay with me. Stay with me.

140
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,910
我们在做毒剂检测  看是不是氰化物胶囊造成的
We're running a tox screen to see if it was a cyanide capsule.

141
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,470
巴顿有妻子有孩子
Barton had a wife and kids.

142
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,990
如果他想自杀  也不可能是自愿的
If he was gonna go, it wouldn't be willingly.

143
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,120
你觉得他是被谋杀的
You think he was murdered.

144
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,380
如果让我猜
If I had to guess,

145
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,360
我肯定押宝给那个杀了斯塔克的人
my money is on the same someone who killed Stark.

146
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,610
但巴顿在一个被时刻监控的囚室里
But Barton was in a locked cell under observation.

147
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,950
毫无打斗痕迹  也没有射入伤
There was no sign of struggle, no entry wounds.

148
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,750
是奇怪  但我还有一具
It's weird, but I also have a space corpse

149
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,580
活脱像奇彭代尔舞团演员的外星尸体
that looks like a Chippendales dancer

150
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,470
在旁边的台子上开始腐坏了
rotting on the next table over.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,630
他就算在腐坏中闻着都还有薰衣草香
Even while rotting, he smells like lavender.

152
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,540
真的吗
Really?

153
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,840
但是实在找不出花花公子亿万富翁
Still, there's not a lot connecting a billionaire playboy

154
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,270
和神盾局杀手的关联  也许你有什么想法
and a S.H.I.E.L.D. Assassin, unless you have any ideas.

155
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,470
我曾经有个想法
There was an idea.

156
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,170
{\an8}周三

157
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,810
{\an8}卡弗大学  弗吉尼亚

158
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,270
罗斯博士  不确定你还记不记得我  但...
Dr. Ross. Not sure if you remember me, but...

159
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,160
我记得
Oh, I remember.

160
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,210
我也会和你说
And I'll tell you the same thing I told you

161
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,700
上次神盾局来人刺探一样的话
the last time S.H.I.E.L.D. Came poking around.

162
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,810
我没见过他
I haven't seen him.

163
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,780
我不是为那个绿色家伙而来
I'm not here about the green guy.

164
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,980
他的名字是布鲁斯·班纳博士
His name is Dr. Bruce Banner.

165
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,690
而且我赶时间  罗曼诺夫特工
And I'm in a rush, Agent Romanoff.

166
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,830
我是为托尼·斯塔克来的  他被谋杀了
I'm here about Tony Stark. I believe he was murdered.

167
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,620
什么  谁干的
What? By whom?

168
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,550
我  或者是有人想要
Me. Or at least someone's trying

169
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,350
用这个让这一切看起来是我干的
to make it look that way, using this.

170
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,810
那你为什么来找我
So, why did you come to me?

171
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,890
你是个细胞生物学
You're an expert 

172
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,660
战术应用的专家
in the tactical applications of cellular biology.

173
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,540
专家不止我一个  你来这的真正目的是什么
There are plenty of others. Why did you really come here?

174
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,970
我得躲过神盾局的追踪
I need to keep this off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar

175
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,420
而你在那个部门里工作过
and you seem to have some experience in that department.

176
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,800
注射器没有问题
Mmm. Well, your injector's clean

177
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,000
而且里面没有任何致命病原体的痕迹
and there's no traces of lethal pathogens of any kind.

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,180
那是什么物质杀了他
Then what killed him?

179
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,020
无论是什么  那都不是生物相关的
Whatever it was, it wasn't biological.

180
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,600
你的解药根本都没有离开注射器
Your antidote didn't even make it out of the syringe.

181
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,590
我看起来倒是觉得
It looks to me like a tiny projectile 

182
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,410
好像有一个微导弹从针头发射了出去
of some kind was fired from the needle.

183
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,180
你是指纳米技术吗
You're thinking nanotech?

184
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,220
我是个生物学家  不是个弹道学专家
I'm a biologist, not a ballistics expert.

185
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,940
我们应该聊完了
And I believe we're done here.

186
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,740
你在做兼职吗  罗斯博士
You got a side job, Dr. Ross?

187
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,660
什么  我不清楚
What? I don't know. I...

188
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,420
一定是某个学生留下的
A student must have left it there.

189
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,880
我有坏消息和更坏的消息
I got bad news and worse news.

190
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,550
-你在安全地点吗  -目前不在
- You in a secure location? - Not currently.

191
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,970
巴顿死了
Barton's dead.

192
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,790
我知道他对你意味着什么
I know what he meant to you.

193
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,980
我要去杀谁
Who do I kill?

194
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,770
看起来他的死还有斯塔克遇害是有联系的
Looks like his and Stark's murders are connected.

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,740
-有什么联系  -复仇者计划
- By what? - The Avengers Initiative.

196
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,780
看起来我们的凶手在追杀这些候选人
Seems our killer is going after the candidates.

197
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,430
如果有人想敲碎神盾局的膝盖
If someone wanted to kneecap S.H.I.E.L.D.,

198
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,010
那他们的切入点不错
that's a good place to start.

199
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,710
名单上还有谁
Who else is on the list?

200
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,830
问题就在这  还有布鲁斯·班纳  和你
That's the thing. Bruce Banner and you.

201
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,700
如果没出这些事  我会觉得很荣幸  克林特也是
Under different circumstances, I'd be flattered. So would Clint.

202
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,640
你得躲好  但先去找到班纳
You need to get yourself to ground. But first, find Banner.

203
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,700
巧了老大  我觉得我已经找到了
Funny thing, boss. Think I already have.

204
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,140
我很抱歉  但我不能让你进去
I... I'm sorry, but I can't let you in there.

205
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,610
让开  别逼我
Move, or I'll make you move.

206
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,720
没有必要使用暴力  罗曼诺夫特工
No need for violence, Agent Romanoff.

207
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,940
不然不会有什么好结果的  对我们任何人来说
That's probably not gonna work out. For anyone.

208
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,840
怎么了  怎么回事
What? What is it?

209
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,270
我们现在就得走了
We need to go. Now.

210
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,710
你在哪里  科尔森
What's your 20, Coulson?

211
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,620
去买咖啡了  需要休息下
Coffee run. Needed a breather.

212
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,610
给你买了双份玛琪雅朵  按你的喜好买的
Got you a double macchiato. Just how you like it.

213
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,060
什么情况
What the...

214
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,290
局长  感应器侦测到大规模能源激增
Director, sensors are reporting a massive energy surge.

215
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,770
像是凭空出现的
Seems like it came out of nowhere.

216
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,200
你看到什么了  科尔森
What are you seeing, Coulson?

217
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,510
某种极端气象现象
A meteorological phenomenon of some kind.

218
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,330
我的老天  出现了很多怪物
Oh, boy. Whatever it is, it came with bogeys.

219
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,140
-看起来像是地球上的吗  -中土的还差不多
- They look like they're from Earth? - Maybe Middle-earth?

220
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,260
拿下他们  老大
Go get 'em, boss.

221
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,880
迷路了吗  先生
Looking for directions, sir?

222
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,020
因为看上去你好像迷路了
Because you seem to have lost your way.

223
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,330
在神的面前  你最好跪下
You would do best to kneel before a god.

224
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,880
我们这里可不兴这一套
We don't really do that here.

225
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,210
不管你是谁或是什么东西
No matter who or what you are.

226
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,020
我是洛基  阿斯加德的王子
I am Loki, Crown Prince of Asgard.

227
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,920
约顿海姆的合法国
The rightful king of Jotun--

228
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,800
合法国王  恶作剧之
Jotunheim. And God of M--

229
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,380
之神  你到底接不接电话
Mischief. Are you gonna take that?

230
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,530
我正在说话呢
I'm in the middle of something here.

231
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,820
该死  弗瑞  接电话啊
Damn it, Fury! Pick up.

232
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,940
我告诉你
Hey, I'm telling you,

233
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,540
让我自己单干对大家来说更安全
it's safer for everyone if I fend for myself.

234
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,120
-我算是不死之身  -那你可走运了
- I sort of can't die. - Then I guess you're in luck.

235
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,090
士兵们  注意
Look alive, people.

236
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
我要突击队全体就位
I want strike teams locked,

237
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,840
准备射击  听我命令行动
loaded, and ready to move in on my mark.

238
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,080
黑寡妇  我这里有点忙
I'm a little busy here, Widow.

239
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,050
真棒  那我们组建一个互助小组吧
Oh, good. We'll start a support group.

240
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,470
我这里有罗斯将军  一打狙击手和几辆坦克
I've got General Ross, a dozen snipers and a few tanks.

241
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,610
-你在忙什么事呢  -太空海盗
- What are you dealing with? - Space Vikings.

242
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,200
-臭显摆  -处理好  然后继续低调行事
- Show-off. - Handle it, then get to ground.

243
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,490
女人的麻烦
Lady trouble?

244
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,820
洛基先生  您为什么到这里来呢
Well, what exactly is it that brought you here, Mr. Loki?

245
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,890
复仇
Vengeance.

246
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,540
这个星球的一名特工杀害了托尔·奥丁森
An agent of this planet murdered Thor Odinson,

247
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,720
阿斯加德的王子
the Crown Prince of Asgard.

248
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,300
我是娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫  神盾局特工
Natasha Romanoff, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

249
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,700
布鲁斯·班纳在我的监护之下  你们都退后
I have Bruce Banner in my custody. You need to stand down.

250
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,190
-不要开枪  -是谁开的枪
- Hey, hey! Don't shoot! - Who the hell opened fire?

251
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,630
不是我们  长官  我们没动手
Not us, sir. We are clear.

252
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,680
布鲁斯  没事  没事的
Bruce! It's okay. We're okay, right?

253
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,990
我会把你救出去的  我以性命起誓
I'll get you out of this. I swear on my life.

254
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,460
弗瑞局长  你并不能
Director Fury, you fail

255
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,260
理解这个事态的严重性
to comprehend the enormity of the situation.

256
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,200
我理解  非常理解
Oh, I'm comprehending all right.

257
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,460
罗曼诺夫特工
Agent Romanoff,

258
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,830
我觉得你最好赶紧离开这里
I think you might be better off getting out of here.

259
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,200
那我就不得不问问了  盒子里是什么
Which is why I have to ask, what's in the box?

260
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,780
我无法容忍你们如此傲慢的态度
Such insolence will not be tolerated.

261
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,850
我将占领你们的星球以做惩戒
And your planet will be taken as retribution.

262
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,270
把他拿下
Take it down!

263
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,630
你想试试这个吗  来啊
Oh, you want some of this? Come on!

264
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,520
爸爸  不要  住手  求你了
Father! No! Stop! Stop, please!

265
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,030
住手
Stop!

266
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,950
你无能为力
There's nothing you can do.

267
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,310
他是我爸爸  他会听我的
That's my father. He'll listen to me.

268
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,450
并不是将军挑起的冲突
The General isn't the one who started this.

269
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,980
那是谁
Then who did?

270
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,590
布鲁斯
Bruce!

271
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,080
布鲁斯
Bruce!

272
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,620
不  不要  布鲁斯
No. No, no, no. Bruce.

273
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,470
但他是不死之身啊  他不会死的
But he can't die. He can't die.

274
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,980
他不会死的
He can't.

275
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,170
在这里发起战争并不能救回你们的王子
Declaring war on this planet will not bring your prince back!

276
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,960
等等
Wait.

277
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,150
他说得没错  诸神之父会让我们三思而行
He's not wrong. The All-Father would want us to listen.

278
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,420
我们有共同的敌人
We have the same enemy here.

279
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,700
杀了你哥哥的人  也杀了两个我的人
The person who killed your brother also killed two of my people.

280
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,550
都是好人  我们应当联合起来
Good people. We should be working together.

281
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,770
我们不是盟友
We are not allies.

282
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,410
那就让我帮你
Then let me help you.

283
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,210
我保证  找到杀你哥哥的凶手时
I promise, when I find your brother's killer,

284
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,230
你也能分一杯羹
you will have your pound of flesh.

285
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,610
多么精妙的遣词用句
What a fascinating choice of words.

286
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,630
但我要完整的尸体
But I shall require the entire corpse.

287
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,610
你要给我时间
You need to give me time.

288
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,440
好
Very well.

289
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,220
下次米德加德日出时
You have until the next rise

290
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,810
你就要交出杀我哥哥的凶手
of Midgard's sun to deliver my brother's assassin,

291
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,410
否则我会将这个星球  化为灰烬和冰川
or I will reduce this planet to ash and ice.

我要看"复仇者计划"的档案
I need to get into the Avengers Initiative files,

296
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,070
但我无法登入系统  而且还是通缉犯
but I'm locked out of the system and wanted for murder.

297
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,310
我才不会告诉你我的密码  罗曼诺夫
I'm not telling you my password, Romanoff.

298
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,950
-为什么不行  -总之不行
- Why not? - Because I'm not.

长官  我明白
Sir, I understand that

321
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,260
类似洛基王子攻击地球这种情况
this Prince Loki situation is the very reason

322
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,080
正是你发起"复仇者计划"的原因
you proposed the Avengers Initiative

323
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,540
利用一组精英战队
for a group of remarkable

什么
What?

332
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,280
那是90年代的呼机吗
Is that a beeper from the '90s?

333
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,710
也是我们最后的希望
Also our last hope.

这不是汉克·皮姆吗
If it isn't Hank Pym.

345
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:43,820
你还敢来这站在她坟前  真是有种
The balls you have to come here and stand over her grave.

346
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,980
别担心她
Oh, don't worry about her.

347
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,810
我不觉得她会介意  毕竟她已经死了
I doubt she'd mind, considering she's dead.

348
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,560
她死了是因为神盾局杀了她
She died because S.H.I.E.L.D. killed her.

349
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,560
她是因你而死
She died because of you.

350

Agent?

她是我女儿  我的宝贝女儿
She was my daughter! My little girl.

354
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,070
她想念她母亲  而你利用了那一点
She missed her mother and you exploited that!

355
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,980
她母亲是个特工吗
Her mother was an agent?

356
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,710
别愚弄我  弗瑞
Don't play the fool with me, Fury.

357
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,290
你给她灌输了一堆
You filled her head with nonsense

358
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,670
保护人类拯救世界的屁话
about protecting humanity and saving the world.

359
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,640
你让她为神盾局干脏活
You just left out how she died the same way her mother did,

360
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,740
像她母亲一样死去
doing S.H.I.E.L.D.'s dirty work!

361
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,740
那就让你能谋杀他们吗
And that gave you permission to murder them?

362
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,420
安托尼·斯塔克  克林特·巴顿
Anthony Stark? Clint Barton?

363
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,180
布鲁斯·班纳  娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫
Bruce Banner? Natasha Romanoff?

364
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,270
你夺走了我的一切
You took everything from me.

365
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,810
我想让你痛苦
I wanted you to hurt.

366
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,720
眼睁睁地看着你建立的
To witness everything you've ever worked for...

367
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,470
为之奋斗的
fought for...

368
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,710
希冀的
hoped for...

369
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,750
崩塌
die.

370
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,320
那托尔呢  阿斯加德王子
And what of Thor, Prince of Asgard?

371
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,950
那个金毛吗  你会毫不犹豫地招募他
Goldilocks? You would have recruited him in a heartbeat.

372
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,550
忽悠他来当英雄
Sold him some malarkey about being a hero.

373
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,810
那就是你干的事  神盾局一直在干的事
That's what you do. What S.H.I.E.L.D. has always done.

374
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,940
找别人去帮你打架吧
Find others to fight your battles.

375
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,470
就这样吗  你杀了他只是因为你能杀死他吗
That's it? You murdered him because you could?

376
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,440
他的死是个添头  你的死才是胜利
His death was a favor. Yours will be a triumph.

377
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,020
搞什么
What the...

378
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,380
作为一个发号施令的人  你还是很有活力啊
You're still pretty spry for a guy with a corner office.

379
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,960
你从没在意过霍普
You never cared about Hope.

380
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,810
我对他们中的任何一个都毫不在意
I don't give a damn about any of them.

381
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,890
弗瑞  来啊
Fury! Come on.

382
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,560
你不说自己是个杀手吗
You're supposed to be a killer? 

383
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,670
那来啊  杀我啊
Well, come on, then. Kill me.

384
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,030
你是怎么...
How are you...

385
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,890
别动来动去的  弗瑞
Stop moving, Fury.

386
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,460
你在干什么  我们...
What are you doing? Let's go--

387
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,190
你怎么到处都是
It's like you're everywhere. Aah!

388
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,170
哪来的哥特小孩
Uh, what's with the goth kid?

389
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,650
你好  我是诡计之神
Hello. Trickster God. Hi.

390
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,910
神盾局就在人民当中
S.H.I.E.L.D. Is people,

391
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,660
人民愿意为了更伟大的事业
people willing to give their lives 

392
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,820
去牺牲他们的生命
for something greater than themselves

393
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,520
去从你这种人手里拯救世界
to save the world from men like you.

394
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,510
霍普·凡·戴恩特工
Agent Hope Van Dyne

395
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,970
理解这一点  我们永远不会忘记她
understood that and she will never be forgotten.

396
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,520
那就给她荣誉
Then you honor her.

397
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,500
给她荣誉
Then honor her.

398
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,640
和你合作非常愉快  弗瑞局长
Well, this was an absolute pleasure, Director Fury.

399
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,710
很好  现在带着你的锤子从地球滚蛋吧
Good. Now take your hammer and get off my planet.

400
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,750
这个问题吧  我们应该结盟
About that, we should be allies.

401
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,670
我刚刚有个想法
You know, I've just had an idea.

402
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,360
我在考虑延长米德加德停留的时间
I was thinking I might extend my stay here on Midgard.

403
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,470
延长多久
For how long?

404
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,210
{\an8}星期五

405
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,110
{\an8}纽约州  联合国

406
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,130
晚上好  我忠诚的子民们
Good evening, my loyal subjects.

407
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,810
我非常骄傲的向你们宣布
It is with great pride that I stand before you today

408
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,470
只花费了一天的时间
to announce that in just one day's time,

409
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,250
地球上的各个国家就摒弃了分歧
the nations of Earth have put aside their differences

410
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,750
在我的领导下联合起来了
and united under my command.

411
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,630
纽约突发新闻

412
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,710
人类潜在的本性让你们渴望被征服
It's the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation.

413
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,970
自由的虚妄诱惑让你们无法前行
The bright lure of freedom hobbles you,

414
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,150
让你们无法感受欢乐
diminishes your life's joy.

415
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,660
你们生来就是被统治的
You were made to be ruled.

416
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:27,610
因此我来帮助你们完成你们的使命
So I have come to help you fulfill your destiny.

417
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,290
复仇者联盟还没来得及崛起就陨落了
The Avengers fell before they had a chance to rise.

418
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,120
愿他们安息
May they rest in peace.

419
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,520
他们可以安息  但我们不会
They can, but we won't.

420
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,840
复仇者联盟的意义不仅限于一支队伍
The Avengers were always meant to be more than a team.

421
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,240
他们是一种理念
They were an idea,

422
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,380
人民在最黑暗的时刻
the affirmation of humanity's need 

423
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,280
需要保持信念
to believe that in our darkest hour,

424
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,580
相信我们会找到英雄
we will find our heroes.

425
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,040
我相信在这个宇宙
I believe that in this universe,

426
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,160
和其他宇宙一样  希望永不消失
as in every other, hope never dies.

427
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:10,170
只要有人还在继续寻找
As long as someone keeps their good eye on the bigger picture.

428
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,180
欢迎归来  队长
Welcome back, Captain.

429
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,830
哪里需要战斗
So where's the fight?
